      <h1>✨Profile README ✨ - A cool spot I've set up just for my GitHub Profile!</h1>
      <h2>Hey everyone! 👋</h2>
      <p>So, I figured I'd start off by telling you a bit about myself, and what makes me tick. 🤔</p>
      <p>Let's cover the basics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Nickname:</strong> Mosberg, but if you're feeling friendly, just call me Moss. It's like a warm hug
            in
            name form! 😊</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>What I Am:</strong> Basically, I'm your typical Joe, just trying to navigate this crazy world!
            🤷‍♂️
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Pronouns:</strong> Whatever floats your boat! I'm a chill person, so go ahead and use whatever
            pronouns
            you feel comfortable with. 🤗</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>Now, let's talk about the stuff that lights me up! 🚀</p>
      <h3>💻 Diving into Code 💻</h3>
      <p>When it comes to the digital playground, I'm like a fish in water:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Languages:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, PHP, SQL, CSV and a dash of Python keep me company. 🐍</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Writing Styles:</strong> I'm a big fan of Markdown for jotting down my thoughts and ideas. 📝</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>🍰 Baking Up a Storm 🍰</h3>
      <p>You know what really gets me going? Cooking and baking! 🥰</p>
      <p>But let's be honest, the real joy is sharing the deliciousness with the people I care about.</p>
      <p>Nothing beats seeing those happy, food-filled faces! 😋</p>
      <h3>📚 Quenching My Thirst for Knowledge 📚</h3>
      <p>To me, every single day is a chance to learn something new! 🤓</p>
      <p>It's like a never-ending buffet of brain food, and I'm always ready to pile my plate high! 🤯</p>
      <h3>👫 Hanging with My Homies 👫</h3>
      <p>When it's time to chill, I'm all about those relaxed moments with my pals and family.</p>
      <p>It's those simple times that mean the most to me. 💛</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Want to know a bit more about the person behind the screen? 🤔</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Family Dynamics:</strong> I'm the baby of five siblings. Talk about being spoiled! 👶</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Skill Set:</strong> I've got two cool titles belts: electrician and plumber. 💪🔧💧</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> I've got baby blue peepers and blonde hair, and I stand tall at 193 cm. Sure,
            I
            might have a few extra pounds, but I blame it on my love for food – and who doesn't love a good meal? 🤤</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>And when I'm not busy being a coding wiz or a kitchen master, you can find me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Learning:</strong> I'm like a sponge with coding tutorials and AI articles. Give me a good read on
            computer science, and I'm in heaven! 🤖</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Gaming:</strong> Retro games have my heart, but I'm also down for some modern gaming action with my
            friends. 🎮</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Traveling:</strong> I've got the travel bug, but so far, I've only been able to explore a few
            places.
            I'm
            eager to see more of this big, beautiful world! 🗺️</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>So, that's a quick peek into my life. 🌟</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoyed getting to know me a little better, and I'm super excited to get to know you too! 🤗</p>
